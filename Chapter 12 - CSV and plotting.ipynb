    "\n",
    "###The CSV Module\n",
    "Each line in a CSV file represents a row in the spreadsheet, and commas separate the cells in the row. Many programs (Excel, SPSS, etc) and webapplications allow you to import and export CSV files.\n",
    "CSV files are simple, lacking many of the features of an Excel spreadsheet. For example, CSV files\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don’t have types for their values—everything is a string\n",
    "* Don’t have settings for font size or color\n",
    "* Don’t have multiple worksheets\n",
    "* Can’t specify cell widths and heights\n",
    "* Can’t have merged cells\n",
    "* Can’t have images or charts embedded in them\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of CSV files is simplicity. CSV files are widely supported by many types of programs, can be viewed in text editors (including IDLE’s file editor), and are a straightforward way to represent spreadsheet data. The CSV format is exactly as advertised: It’s just a text file of comma-separated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Why not use .split()/.strip()?\n",
    "\n",
    "We already a learned another way to do this, we've learned split(\",\") to split each row of text into comma-delimited fields, and then strip() to take off the quote marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few good reasons to use the CSV module here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The csv module makes it clear what you're doing to anyone reading your code.\n",
    "* The csv module is less likely to contain an error that splits some lines the wrong way.\n",
    "* The csv module has a lot of other features, documented here. These allow it to process differently formatted files, so you can easily update your program if the file format changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####Reader Objects\n",
