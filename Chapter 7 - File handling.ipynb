    "In this chapter you will learn how to read data from and write data to files. This is quite and essential part of programming, as it is the first step for your program to communicate with the outside world. In most cases you will write programs that take data from some source, manipulates it in someway and writes it out somewhere. For example if you would write a survey, you could take input from participants and save their answers in some files. When the survey is over you would read these files in and do some analysis on the data you have collected and save your results. In this chapter we will read in texts, analyze them a bit, and save out our analysis to files. "

    "Input for your programs often comes from files on your disk, such as texts or some data in csv format. Likewise, you often want output to be written back to files on your disk as well e.g.: you collect tweets about a certain topic and you write it to a file for later analysis. Thus, reading and writing files is often an essential part of programming and, lucky, for us, this is really simple in Python. The following example reads a file from disk:"

    ">You may wonder what an encoding is and what *utf-8* is. For anyone working with texts and computers this is vital to know. Internally, a computer knows no characters whatsoever: every piece of information is represented as numbers (which in turn are represented in a binary format, as zeroes and ones). An encoding specifies which numbers represent which characters. A famous and long-standing encoding scheme is ASCII, in which for example the letter 'A' is encoded using the number 65. ASCII however only has a very limited alphabet and can not encode a lot of writing systems. A modern-day encoding supporting countless writing systems is *unicode* and *utf-8* is a kind of unicode. This the type of encoding that you will want to use for your data whenever possible. Whenever you have a choice, you should use unicode!"
