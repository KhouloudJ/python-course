    "In this chapter you will learn how to read data from and write data to files. This is quite and essential part of programming, as it is the first step for your program to communicate with the outside world. In most cases you will write programs that take data from some source, manipulates it in someway and writes it out somewhere. For example if you would write a survey, you could take input from participants and save their answers in some files. When the survey is over you would read these files in and do some analysis on the data you have collected and save your results. In this chapter we will read in texts, analyze them a bit, and save out our analysis to files. "

    "Input for your programs often comes from files on your disk, such as texts or some data in csv format. Likewise, you often want output to be written back to files on your disk as well e.g.: you collect tweets about a certain topic and you write it to a file for later analysis. Thus, reading and writing files is often an essential part of programming and, lucky, for us, this is really simple in Python. The following example reads a file from disk:"

    ">You may wonder what an encoding is and what *utf-8* is. For anyone working with texts and computers this is vital to know. Internally, a computer knows no characters whatsoever: every piece of information is represented as numbers (which in turn are represented in a binary format, as zeroes and ones). An encoding specifies which numbers represent which characters. A famous and long-standing encoding scheme is ASCII, in which for example the letter 'A' is encoded using the number 65. ASCII however only has a very limited alphabet and can not encode a lot of writing systems. A modern-day encoding supporting countless writing systems is *unicode* and *utf-8* is a kind of unicode. This the type of encoding that you will want to use for your data whenever possible. Whenever you have a choice, you should use unicode!"

As you can see in the example below, this keeps the annoying trainling new line characters \"\\n\" at the end of the lines.

In Sublime, for instance, you can first save your file with a \".py\" extension, and then 'build' your code by hitting Ctrl+b (Windows, Unix) or Command+b (Mac OS X). You will now see that the output of your script will be written to your screen in Sublime.\n",

In general, you should always watch out when you use a command line interface to your machine: only execute commands that you (more or less) understand! You typically have complete control over your machine via such an interface, so you need to watch out not to remove any important files.

Alternatively, click the magnifying glass in the top-right of your screen (shortcut: Command key+Spacebar).

To make the program fully executable you might have to \"chmod\" it first (CHange file MODes), using the command `chmod +x script.py`. With this command you tell your machine, that it is safe to execute this script. For additional info on these scripts and the options they take, you can always run the `man` command (e.g. `man chmod`). A good tutorial that covers the basics of the bash command line interface on Unix-like operating systems is: http://praxis.scholarslab.org/tutorials/bash/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under a Windows operating system, you can simply double-click the script.py function: because of the `.py` extension your OS will automatically run the script via Python interpreter (note that the `shebang line` is in reality ignored in your `script.py`). Alternatively, go to Start > All programs > Accessories and click on Command Prompt. In the Search or Run line, you can also type `cmd` and press enter. This will open a DOS console window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the folder that holds you script.py: in our case you could do this via the command: `cd C:\\documents and settings\\your_username\\desktop` or simply `cd desktop`. Next, execute our script by typing: `python3 script.py`. With this command, we explicitly tell the machine to execute this script using `python` (at least it's default version on your machine). Normally, the output of the `print(), should now have been send to your console window. Has it?

To launch such an interpreter, just type in `python3` in your console and hit enter. This will launch a `live` Python session in your command line console where you can experiment with your data by typing in commands, much like you have done in the IPython environment so far. Try this out! Just type in lines of Python code after the `>>>` prompt and hit enter to execute it immediately."
