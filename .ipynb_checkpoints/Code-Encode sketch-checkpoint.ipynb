    "First we will turn every character in the users message to these interegers and we will be left with something like: \"Abba\" --> 65 98 98 97. Let's call this the \"Dumn ASCII Machine\" (DAM). The problem with DAM is that its a pretty transparent cipher: you have as many characters in the code as in the original string, plus it uses one of the most well-known character encoding. What we are going to do is to use DAM to turn string into numbers and then add just one level of complexity on top: we are going to turn all these integers into bitstrings. The way we are going to do it is that we define a list of numbers lets say [2,3,4,5] and we will divide the numbers in the output of DAM by these numbers. DAM(\"a\") returns let's say 10, then: \n",
