    "In programming, it is often very useful do carry out a the same action for a series of different items. You might, for instance, want to go through a list of words and count and print the number of characters in each word. Or, you might want to do a calculation multiple times. Basically, if you have a program where you repeat certain steps, it is a good idea to use loops. A loop let's Python perform a specific piece of code multiple times. "

    "- **Exercise 2:** \"99 Bottles of Beer\" is a traditional song in the United States and Canada. It is popular to sing on long trips, as it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize, and can take a long time to sing. The song's simple lyrics are as follows: \"99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.\" The same verse is repeated, each time with one fewer bottle. The song is completed when the singer or singers reach zero. Your task here is write a Python code block capable of generating all the verses of the song. Use a `counter` integer variable and a `while` loop. Make sure that your loop will come to an end and that the inflection of the word bottle is adapted to the counter!\n"
