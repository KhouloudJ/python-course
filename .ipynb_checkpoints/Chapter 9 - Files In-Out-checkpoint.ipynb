    "In this chapter you will learn how to read data from files, do some analysis and write the results to disk. Reading and writing files is quite an essential part of programming, as it is the first step for your program to communicate with the outside world. In most cases you will write programs that take data from some source, manipulates it in someway and writes some results out somewhere. For example if you would write a survey, you could take input from participants on a webserver and save their answers in some files or in a database. When the survey is over you would read these results in and do some analysis on the data you have collected, maybe do some visualizations and save your results."
