    "After lists the second major Python data structure is the **dictionary**. While lists and dictionaries might come across as very similar, they have different pros and cons. Programming is mostly about solving real-world problems as efficiently as possible, but it is also important to write and organize code in a human readable fashion. A dictionary offers a kind of abstraction that comes in handy a lot of times: it is a type of \"associative memory\" or key:value storage. It allows you to describe two pieces of data and their relationship. This might seem a bit too abstract, but lets break it down.\n",
